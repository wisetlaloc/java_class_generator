# JavaClassGenerator
As a Java Novice (and a Ruby intermidiate), I found writing Java Classes by hand were tedious work.
This tool requires information of your new Java Class and generates code for Copy & Paste.

## Installation
You need a ruby & rubygems environment.

```shell
gem install bundler
bundle
```

## Usage
```shell
ruby main.rb User String:username String:firstname
```
